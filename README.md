# LuaMaker 0.1 - LÃ–VE2D Game development library



.:Only 10kb library size:.

.:Uses snake_case:.

.:Similar to GameMaker:.

================================

# How to use:


Insert all your assets inside the "game_files" folder,
and sort them into each category (images, sounds or fonts).

To create a new object/room, open their respective folders
and copy the "_template.lua" file and rename it to whatever you
want, inside the new file just edit the parameters and functions,
use "self." to mention a variable from inside that code.

Every .lua file inside script folder will be run when the game
starts, so use it to define global variables and custom functions.
